# `luaoptions`
Option handling for LuaLaTeX packages

This package has been extracted from [`lyluatex`](https://github.com/jperon/lyluatex)
where it was originally developed as supporting functionality. However, as it turned out
it is useful as a building block for LuaLaTeX packages in general, and the development of
[`luaformatters`](https://github.com/lualatex-tools/luaformatters) made it clear that
the option handling code had to be moved to a standalone package.

Initially there is no extensive documentation available since the package wasn't originally
intended to be exposed to third-party packages or even end-users, and it is at this point
only released to make the release of `luaformatters` possible.
